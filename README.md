# 8080Disassembler
Disassembles 8080 Code into assembly. Made as a small project while learning how to write emulators.

## Instructions (Assuming the user is using bash)
1. Run command: make (This command will compile the code and generate the executable)
2. Run command: ./8080Disassembler {File path to 8080 code file} (The file path in this case would be local to the executables directory)
3. After running the previous command all of the 8080 assembly code will be displayed
4. Run command: make clean (Optional command to clear out unneeded object file)
